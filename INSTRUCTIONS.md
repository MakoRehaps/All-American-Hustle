# Manual Integration Guide for RPG Mechanics in All-American Hustle

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to manually apply the RPG mechanics and quest system changes to your local copy of the All-American Hustle game.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- Python 3.x installed
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`)

## Steps to Apply Changes

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MakoRehaps/All-American-Hustle.git
   cd All-American-Hustle
   ```

2. Create a new branch for the RPG mechanics:
   ```
   git checkout -b rpg-quest-system
   ```

3. Create a new directory for RPG mechanics:
   ```
   mkdir rpg_mechanics
   ```

4. Create a new file `rpg_mechanics/rpg_system.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   # Copy the content of the rpg_system.py file here
   ```

5. Update the `data/scripts/paintown.py` file:
   - Open the file in your preferred text editor
   - Replace the existing content with the updated version that includes RPG mechanics
   - Make sure to import the necessary modules and classes from `rpg_system.py`

6. Create a new `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
   project(AllAmericanHustle)

   # Specify the C++ standard
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

   # Add the source files
   file(GLOB SOURCES "src/*.cpp")

   # Add the executable
   add_executable(AllAmericanHustle ${SOURCES})

   # TODO: Add any necessary libraries or dependencies
   ```

7. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git add rpg_mechanics/ data/scripts/paintown.py CMakeLists.txt
   git commit -m "Add RPG mechanics and quest system"
   ```

## Running the Game

To run the game with the new RPG mechanics:

1. Navigate to the `data/scripts` directory:
   ```
   cd data/scripts
   ```

2. Run the `paintown.py` script:
   ```
   python paintown.py
   ```

3. The game should now start with the integrated RPG mechanics and quest system.

## Testing the RPG Mechanics

While playing the game, pay attention to the following new features:

1. Character progression (leveling up, gaining experience)
2. Inventory management
3. Quest system (accepting quests, tracking progress, completing objectives)

## Providing Feedback

After testing the game, please provide feedback on the following aspects:

1. How well do the RPG mechanics integrate with the existing beat 'em up gameplay?
2. Is the character progression system balanced and engaging?
3. Are the quests interesting and do they add depth to the game?
4. Any bugs or issues encountered during gameplay?
5. Suggestions for improvements or additional features

Please share your feedback with the development team to help improve and refine the RPG mechanics in All-American Hustle.
