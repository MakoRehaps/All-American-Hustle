# Manual Integration Guide for RPG Mechanics in All-American Hustle

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to manually apply the RPG mechanics and quest system changes to your local copy of the All-American Hustle game.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on your local machine
- Python 3.x installed
- Pygame library installed (`pip install pygame`)

## Steps to Apply Changes

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MakoRehaps/All-American-Hustle.git
   cd All-American-Hustle
   ```

2. Create a new branch for the RPG mechanics:
   ```
   git checkout -b rpg-quest-system
   ```

3. Create a new directory for RPG mechanics:
   ```
   mkdir rpg_mechanics
   ```

4. Create a new file `rpg_mechanics/rpg_system.py` with the following content:
   ```python
   # Copy the content of the rpg_system.py file here
   ```

5. Update the `data/scripts/paintown.py` file:
   - Open the file in your preferred text editor
   - Replace the existing content with the updated version that includes RPG mechanics
   - Make sure to import the necessary modules and classes from `rpg_system.py`

6. Create a new `CMakeLists.txt` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
   project(AllAmericanHustle)

   # Specify the C++ standard
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)
   set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

   # Add the source files
   file(GLOB SOURCES "src/*.cpp")

   # Add the executable
   add_executable(AllAmericanHustle ${SOURCES})

   # TODO: Add any necessary libraries or dependencies
   ```

7. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git add rpg_mechanics/ data/scripts/paintown.py CMakeLists.txt
   git commit -m "Add RPG mechanics and quest system"
   ```

## Running the Game

To run the game with the new RPG mechanics:

1. Navigate to the `data/scripts` directory:
   ```
   cd data/scripts
   ```

2. Run the `paintown.py` script:

   python paintown.py
   ```

3. The game should now start with the integrated RPG mechanics and quest system.
